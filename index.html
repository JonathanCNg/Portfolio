    <h1>Biography</h1>
    <p>I have always been fascinated by how technology makes nearly all aspects of life easier. I enjoy learning about innovations in mobile devices, playing computer games and solving complex problems with digital solutions. These interests, combined, shaped my passion for Computer Science.</p>
    <p>I am currently a sophomore at Pasadena City College (PCC) studying Computer Science. I lead as Vice President the Society of Women Engineers and she.codes, two distinct organizations at PCC with the shared goal of bridging the gender gap in STEM. I love eating dim sum, drinking boba, riding roller-coasters, dancing and watching scary movies.</p>
